# Chore List

A table that keeps track of chores, their due dates, and dates created
. Heavily inspired by the FreeCodeCamp Youtube video, [Learn flask for
 Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1RJmh_OqeA&feature=emb_title).

'Model' will be used for GUI application.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Languages/Libraries

What things you need to install the software

```
Python

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

First, you will want to copy or clone the github project folder to your system.

```
git clone https://github.com/8BitJustin/chore_list.git
```

While in the directory with the app.py file present, use the following command:

```
python app.py
```

Once running, go to the localhost link below to view:
